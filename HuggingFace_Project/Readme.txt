This project comes from https://b23.tv/caKYiZU. By running run.py in the cmd window, you can input any sentence you want, then it will output the emotion type it represents.
In this project, my training rounds only last 15 epoches and the validation precision can be up to 0.88.
Feel free to try that~~~~~~~
